        <h2>Super Naruto World</h2>
        <img src="home.PNG">
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Super Mario World is a game that Sebastian Nguyen and I created.</p>
        <p>We combined the  elements of the popular anime, Naruto, and the
       prominent Super Mario games.</p>
       <p>We added points as Naruto, the character you control, walked,</p>
       <p>this was included as the enemy would charge towards the player.</p>
       <p>Game difficulty would increase with more random movement.</p>
       <p>You would die when you lose all 3 lives (hearts).</p>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>We created this game as we are avid Naruto fans, and sought for a side scroller
        that would be reminiscent of Super Mario Games.</p>
        <p>I was very fond of the graphics and fluidity of the movement.</p>
        <p>Some difficulties we faced were creating the levels, and
        editing the animations.</p>
        <p>If we had more time and resources, we would make more levels
        and enemies.</p>
        <p>We made an algorithim that would switch levels when you die to the enemy.</p>
        <p>This algorithim made it possible to end the game.</p>

       <h2 id="Story">Ziggy's</h2>
        <p>Ziggy's is a real life simulation game depicting a night with the Restroom Boys. The goal of the game is to find a task to do for the night; however, the Restroom Boys are faced with turmoil, tears, and tragedy along the way. As the player, you must find a way past these issues.</p>

        <p>When we created the game, we intended to include a timer to hurry the player, and see their performance under pressure. Throughout the project, we faced many difficulties. For example, we had trouble writing out the decisions; to fix this issue, we simply used the print function instead of the line function. Moving on, the advantages of building a program through procedural abstraction allowed for better organization and playability for the user. A story we were fond of was Jeremy Nguyen's, it included many options and flowed smoothly.</p>
