        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Super Mario World is a game that Sebastian Nguyen and I created.</p>
        <p>We combined the  elements of the popular anime, Naruto, and the
       prominent Super Mario games.</p>
       <p>We added points as Naruto, the character you control, walked,</p>
       <p>this was included as the enemy would charge towards the player.</p>
       <p>Game difficulty would increase with more random movement.</p>
       <p>You would die when you lose all 3 lives (hearts).</p>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>We created this game as we are avid Naruto fans, and sought for a side scroller
        that would be reminiscent of Super Mario Games.</p>
        <p>I was very fond of the graphics and fluidity of the movement.</p>
        <p>Some difficulties we faced were creating the levels, and
        editing the animations.</p>
        <p>If we had more time and resources, we would make more levels
        and enemies.</p>
        <p>We made an algorithim that would switch levels when you die to the enemy.</p>
        <p>This algorithim made it possible to end the game.</p>
